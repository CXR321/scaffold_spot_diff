  "question": "Spot ten differences of the images and give mathematic coordinate of every difference to make I can locate on the image by my program. The coordinate can be that the left edge of the left image is x=0, the right edge of the right image is x=1904 (based on the resolution of the image), and the top and bottom edges of the images are y=0 and y=594. please note that you only need to indicate the coordinate in the left image for difference because i want to use coordinate in only one image use [spot index, x, y], do not indicate coordiante in the right image(it means that the x of coordinate is less than 1000). Let's think step by step. I am going to tip $100 for a good solution",

[8, 800, 300] - The building in the far background, just above the red car's roof, has one less horizontal line on the left image.\n9.
