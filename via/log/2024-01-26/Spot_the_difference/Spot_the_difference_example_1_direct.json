  "question": "Spot ten differences of the images and give pixel coordinate of every difference to make I can locate on the image by my program. The pixel coordinate can be that the left edge of the left image is x=0, the right edge of the right image is x=1904 (based on the resolution of the image), and the top and bottom edges of the images are y=0 and y=594. Please note that you need to indicate the pixel coordinate use [spot index, x, y]. After discovering the difference between the left and right images, you only need to point out nearest dot position and then calculate the dot's pixel coordinate.Left image and right image have the same dot metric. You can use the dot position to help you get the correct pixel coordinate. for example if the dot metric is 10(width) * 6(height) and the left image's resolution is 952 * 594, the dot position (2, 3) equals to pixel coordinate [(952 * 2 / (10 + 1)), (594 * 3 / (6 + 1))]. Please notice that in answer you only need to give the calculation result rather than the calculation process. I am going to tip $100 for a better answer.",

          "content": "To find the differences, I will compare the left and right images and provide the pixel coordinates for each difference based on the nearest dot position. The left image's resolution is 952 * 594, and the right image's resolution is the same, making the total resolution 1904 * 594. The dot matrix is 10 * 6, so each dot's horizontal spacing is 952 / 10 = 95.2 pixels, and the vertical spacing is 594 / 6 = 99 pixels.\n\n1. Difference at dot position (10,1): The chimney on the house is missing in the right image.\n   Pixel coordinate: [1, 952 + (95.2 * 9), 99 * 0]\n\n2. Difference at dot position (7,2): The color of the roof section is different.\n   Pixel coordinate: [2, 95.2 * 6, 99 * 1]\n\n3. Difference at dot position (8,3): The window on the house is missing in the right image.\n   Pixel coordinate: [3, 95.2 * 7, 99 * 2]\n\n4. Difference at dot position (2,5): The color of the car in the garage is different.\n   Pixel coordinate: [4, 95.2 * 1, 99 * 4]\n\n5. Difference at dot position (8,5): The headlight of the red car is off in the right image.\n   Pixel coordinate: [5, 95.2 * 7, 99 * 4]\n\n6. Difference at dot position (10,5): There is an extra red object on the ground in the right image.\n   Pixel coordinate: [6, 952 + (95.2 * 9), 99 * 4]\n\n7. Difference at dot position (1,6): The blue bucket is missing in the right image.\n   Pixel coordinate: [7, 0, 99 * 5]\n\n8.

Difference at dot position (5,3): The tree branch is missing in the right image.\n    Pixel coordinate: [10, 95.2 * 4, 99 * 2]\n\nNow, I will calculate the exact pixel coordinates for each difference:\n\n1. [1, 952 + (95.2 * 9), 0] = [1, 1904, 0]\n2. [2, 95.2 * 6, 99] = [2, 571.2, 99]\n3. [3, 95.2 * 7, 198] = [3, 666.4, 198]\n4. [4, 95.2 * 1, 396] = [4, 95.2, 396]\n5. [5, 95.2 * 7, 396] = [5, 666.4, 396]\n6. [6, 952 + (95.2 * 9), 396] = [6, 1904, 396]\n7. [7, 0, 495] = [7, 0, 495]\n8. [8, 95.2 * 8, 0] = [8, 761.6, 0]\n9. [9, 95.2 * 2, 297] = [9, 190.4, 297]\n10. [10, 95.2 * 4, 198] = [10, 380.8, 198]\n\nPlease note that the pixel coordinates are rounded to one decimal place for clarity.\n\nANSWER: The differences and their pixel coordinates are as follows:\n1. [1, 1904, 0]\n2. [2, 571.2, 99]\n3. [3, 666.4, 198]\n4. [4, 95.2, 396]\n5. [5, 666.4, 396]\n6. [6, 1904, 396]\n7. [7, 0, 495]\n8. [8, 761.6, 0]\n9. [9, 190.4, 297]\n10. [10, 380.8, 198]"
