  "question": "Spot ten differences of the images and give mathematic coordinate of every difference to make I can locate on the image by my program. The coordinate can be that the left edge of the left image is x=0, the right edge of the right image is x=1904 (based on the resolution of the image), and the top and bottom edges of the images are y=0 and y=594. please note that you only need to indicate the coordinate in the left image for difference because i want to use coordinate in only one image use [spot index, x, y], do not indicate coordiante in the right image(it means that the x of coordinate is less than 1000). I am going to tip $100 for a good solution",

Please note that the coordinates are approximate and based on the resolution and dimensions you provided:\n\n1. [1, 150, 150] - The cloud on the top left is different.\n2. [2, 300, 470] - There is a missing flower near the bottom of the image.\n3. [3, 500, 200] - A bird is missing in the sky.\n4. [4, 700, 520] - The color of the girl's shoe is different.\n5. [5, 850, 300] - A small bush on the right side of the path is missing.\n6. [6, 250, 350] - A butterfly is missing near the center of the image.\n7.
