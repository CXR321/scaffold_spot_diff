Here are the differences I can spot:\n\n1. The bird flying in the sky on the left side is missing in the right image.\n2. The cloud shape in the top middle part of the sky is different.\n3. The shadow under the elephant is different.\n4. The elephant's eye is different.\n5. The tree on the far left has a different number of branches.\n6. The color of the elephant's tusk is different.\n7. There is a small plant near the elephant's front foot in the left image that is missing in the right image.\n8. The tree on the right side of the elephant has a different number of leaves.\n9. The mountain peak in the background on the left side is missing in the right image.\n10. The color of the elephant's inner ear is different.\n\nPlease note that without the ability to provide exact coordinates, you would need to visually inspect the image to locate these differences."
