The coordinate can be that the left edge of the left image is x=0, the right edge of the right image is x=1904 (based on the resolution of the image), and the top and bottom edges of the images are y=0 and y=594. please note that you only need to indicate the coordinate in the left image for difference because i want to use coordinate in only one image use [spot index, x, y].",
